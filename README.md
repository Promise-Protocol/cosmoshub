# Welcome to CosmosHub

## Welcome to CosmosHub

Inspired by the amazing work of the team at [EthHub](https://ethub.io), CosmosHub aims to provide a single source for essential Cosmos information and up-to-date information on the Cosmos development roadmap. Currently, CosmosHubs launched with three main sections:

1. [Docs](https://docs.cosmosHub.io) - Cosmos documentation
2. [Roadmap] - The Cosmos Protocol Roadmap
3. [Newsletter](https://ethhub.substack.com) - CosmosHub Updates and Blog

The Docs and the Roadmap are two sections that we expect will deliver the most impact for developers exploring onboarding Cosmos.
